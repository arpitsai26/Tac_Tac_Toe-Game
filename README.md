A colorful two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python and Tkinter, featuring dynamic turn tracking and win detection. Symbols are color-coded (red for X, blue for O) with visual highlights for winning moves.













‎🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Python + Tkinter) A simple yet polished two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Python and Tkinter. This project features a clean graphical interface, dynamic turn tracking, and visual feedback for winning moves. Players alternate between X and O, with each symbol color-coded (red for X, blue for O) to enhance clarity and engagement. When a player wins, the winning combination is highlighted in green and a pop-up announces the result. This game demonstrates core concepts of event-driven programming, GUI layout management, and basic game logic. It’s beginner-friendly, easy to extend, and perfect for learning how to build interactive desktop applications in Python.
